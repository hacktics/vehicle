<h2>Viewstate Hidden Event Enumerator!</h2>
<h3>An advanced toolset for testing modern web application frameworks and rich internet applications.</h3>

<p>
VEHICLE (formerly known as ria-scip) is a pentest platform with advanced testing features for modern web application frameworks (MWAF) and rich internet applications (RIA).<br><br>
It enables testers to <b>affect various server control properties</b> and <b>enumerate & execute dormant events of invisible</b>, visible, disabled and commented server web controls 
(currently supported for <b>ASP.net</b> and <b>Mono</b>).<br><br>

These features are implemeted by abusing application mis-configurations and framework-specific programming flaws, and by manipulating proprietary input formats.<br>

The project is implemented as an extension to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/" target="_blank">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a> project.
</p>

<p>Developed by <a href="http://www.hacktics.com" target="_blank">Hacktics ASC</a><br>

<p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li> VEHICLE requires Java <u>1.7.x</u>, and was tested with ZAP <u>v.2.x</u>.</li>
<li> Verify that ZAP proxy is executed using Java 1.7.x, prior to running the installer.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
VEHICLE can locate insecure ASP.net configuration, as well as locate traces of invisible, disabled and commented controls and events. It can then be used to enumerate invisible controls, and execute dormant events of server controls by forging a valid postback call (invisible controls without event validation or disabled & commented controls in any scenario), or by reconstructing the viewstate and eventvalidation fields of invisible controls (in case the eventvalidation is on but the MAC is off).<br>
<br>
VEHICLE also provides a manual interface for performing additional RIA/ASP.net targeted attacks such as reusing hijacked viewstate/eventvalidation fields, reconstructing viewstate fields after content alteration/parameter tampering, etc.<br>

<p>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
VEHICLE can currently be used by right-clicking on any ASP.net page in ZAP's treeview. <br>
Currently supports ASP.net, while the next release will support mono and additional technologies.
